    <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
    <p>The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The
        following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.
    </p>

    <h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>These are the Terms and Conditions governing the use of this Service and the agreement that operates between You
        and the Company. These Terms and Conditions set out the rights and obligations of all users regarding the use of
        the Service.</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and
        Conditions. These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>User Accounts</h2>
    <p>When You create an account with Us, You must provide Us information that is accurate, complete, and current at
        all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of Your
        account on Our Service.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <h3>Subscription period</h3>
    <p>The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be billed in
        advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending on the type of
        Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.</p>
    <p>At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You
        cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>

    <h3>Subscription cancellations</h3>
    <p>You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company.
        You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Subscription period and You will be
        able to access the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.</p>

    <h3>Billing</h3>
    <p>You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state,
        zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.</p>
    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating
        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
        billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

    <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
    <p>The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee
        change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.</p>
    <p>The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an
        opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement
        to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

    <h3>Refunds</h3>
    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
    <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at
        the sole discretion of the Company.</p>

    <p>The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited period of time.</p>
    <p>You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
    <p>If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged by the Company
        until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You cancelled Your
        Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription
        You have selected.</p>
    <p>At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free
        Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

        whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers
        under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
